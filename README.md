# Project

This repository is initialized as an independent Git repo under `project/`.

- Parent repo now ignores `project/`.
- You can add your own remote and start committing normally.

## Quick Start

```pwsh
# from this folder
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
# git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
# git push -u origin main
```
